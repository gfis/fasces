# Path expressions for 5.Ls
# 2018-02-22, Georg Fischer
# Path expressions are built with 2 operations:
# "/X"    - reverse the sequence of elements in X
# "X.n+m" - insert digit m after the digit for 5^n in each element of X
# Examples: [].0+1 = [1]; [12].0+3 = [123]; [12].2+3 = [312]; [1234].1+0 = [12304];
